# Voice-Bridge

A local bridge daemon and CLI that registers Git repositories and returns an honest briefing for each one. It needs Node.js 26 or newer.

## Run it

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
node dist/daemon.js --port 4517
```

The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1` only. In another terminal:

```sh
node dist/cli.js register /path/to/repo   # reads /path/to/repo/.voice/config.json
node dist/cli.js projects
node dist/cli.js open <project_id>
```

State lives in `VOICE_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR` when that is set, otherwise in the OS application-data folder (`~/Library/Application Support/voice-bridge` on macOS). The folder holds `bridge.sqlite`, the `client-token` (mode 0600) that every `/tools/*` call presents as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and `daemon.json`, which tells the CLI which port the running daemon chose.

## Checks

```sh
python harness/ci.py   # runs npx --no-install tsc --noEmit, then npm test
```

`npm test` keeps `--test-reporter=tap`: the harness counts tests from TAP's `# tests N` line, and Node's default reporter does not print one.
